Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: Agricultural Production Optimization Engine: Project Overview](https://github.com/omkargawade-10/Agricultural_Production_Optimization_Engine)
* Created a tool that suggest the most suitable crops to grow based on the available Climatic and Soil conditions.
* Achieving Precision Farming by Optimizing the Agricultural Production.
* We have to optimize Productivity.
* By understanding requirements of Climatic and Soil conditions for Crops.
* Help us to cope up with weather unpredicability.
* I have used K-Means Clustering and Logestic Regression to reach the best model.

# [Project 2: Can Customer Payback the Loan Prediction Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/omkargawade-10/Can_Customer_Payback_the_Loan_Prediction_Model)
* Created a tool that suggest the borrower will pay back their loan or not.
* Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower     will pay back their loan?
* This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
* I have used Tensorflow, Keras and Deep Learning to reach the best model.

# [Project 3: Titanic Disaster Survival: Project Overview](https://github.com/omkargawade-10/Titanic_Disaster_Survival)
* Created a tool that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
* On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats     for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
* In this we have build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-         economic class, etc).
* I have used Logestic Regression to reach the best model.
