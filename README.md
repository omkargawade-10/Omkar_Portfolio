[#Project 1: Agricultural Production Optimization Engine: Project Overview](https://github.com/omkargawade-10/Agricultural_Production_Optimization_Engine)
* Created a tool that suggest the most suitable crops to grow based on the available Climatic and Soil conditions.
* Achieving Precision Farming by Optimizing the Agricultural Production.
* We have to optimize Productivity.
* By understanding requirements of Climatic and Soil conditions for Crops.
* Help us to cope up with weather unpredicability.
* I have used K-Means Clustering and Logestic Regression to reach the best model.

[#Project 1: Can Customer Payback the Loan Prediction Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/omkargawade-10/Can_Customer_Payback_the_Loan_Prediction_Model)
* Created a tool that suggest the borrower will pay back their loan or not.
* Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower     will pay back their loan?
* This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
* I have used Tensorflow, Keras and Deep Learning to reach the best model.
